PipelineDeals' central goal is to help sales teams manage their deal flow. The Deal is the main domain object we care about.

Each deal has:
* A deal stage: where is it in the pipeline?
* A value: how much is the deal worth?

Your challenge is the following: build an app that does one thing - displays a single page, containing a column chart. The x-axis is the deal stage, and the y-axis is the total $ value of deals in that stage.

Details:
* You'll need an api_key to retrieve all deals available to you.
* Every deal has a deal stage, which is included in the deals.json API response
* A deal stage has a 'percent' field, representing where in the pipeline it sits: 100 = finished. Make sure the deal stage columns in your column chart are ordered by deal stage percentage.
* Ruby for the backend, react front-end
* Add tests for any backend code
* Branch right after creating the new rails app. When complete, create a pull request to your branch and share with us.
